# hotel_reviews_sentiment_analysis
This repository contains sentiment analysis of hotel visitor reviews around Sarinah

in this repository, I use serpapi to retrieve data using the API from google maps to retrieve reviews from each visitor regarding service satisfaction and satisfaction with the facilities provided by the hotel

The process carried out is to search for hotels using queries to the google maps API around Sarinah coordinates, then retrieve data from 6 hotels with 50 reviews each. After that, each review will be processed to be predicted using the NLP method and compared with the rating received by each hotels
